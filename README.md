# ML_AI_Portfolio

**Introduction:**

My name is Dakota Kirtley. My background in machine learning consists of my courses and projects that were completed during my time as a graduate student concentrating in mechanical engineering at the University of Akron in Akron, Ohio. 
This portfolio is to serve as a sandbox for me to further hone my skills in the arena of AI/ML. Additionally, it will serve as a showcase to potential employers that while I do not have professional experience in developing AI/ML, that I do have a sound knowledgebase, a passion for the subject, and a desire to put in the time outside of school and work to continue my learning journey in this subject area.
